abstract = {We describe a finite element algorithm for modeling stimulated Brillouin scattering in optical waveguides of arbitrary cross-section. The method allows rapid calculation of optical and elastic dispersion relations, field profiles, and gain. Additionally, we provide an open and extensible set of standard problems and reference materials to facilitate the bench-marking of our solver against subsequent tools. Such a resource is needed to help settle discrepancies between existing formulations and implementations, and to facilitate comparison between results in the literature. The resulting standardized testing framework will allow the community to gain confidence in new algorithms and will provide a common tool for the comparison of experimental designs of opto-acoustic waveguides.},

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {Inelastic scattering processes such as Brillouin scattering can often function in cascaded regimes and this is likely to occur in certain integrated opto-acoustic devices. We develop a Hamiltonian formalism for cascaded Brillouin scattering valid for both quantum and classical regimes. By regarding Brillouin scattering as the interaction of a single acoustic envelope and a single optical envelope that covers all Stokes and anti-Stokes orders, we obtain a compact model that is well suited for numerical implementation, extension to include other optical nonlinearities or short pulses, and application in the quantum-optics domain. We then theoretically analyze intra-mode forward Brillouin scattering (FBS) for arbitrary waveguides with and without optical dispersion. In the absence of optical dispersion, we find an exact analytical solution. With a perturbative approach, we furthermore solve the case of weak optical dispersion. Our work leads to several key results on intra-mode FBS. For negligible dispersion, we show that cascaded intra-mode FBS results in a pure phase modulation and discuss how this necessitates specific experimental methods for the observation of fiber-based and integrated FBS. Further, we discuss how the descriptions that have been established in these two classes of waveguides connect to each other and to the broader context of cavity opto-mechanics and Raman scattering. Finally, we draw an unexpected striking similarity between FBS and discrete diffraction phenomena in waveguide arrays, which makes FBS an interesting candidate for future research in quantum-optics.}

The treatment presented here is based on the Hamiltonian for the opto-acoustic interaction, but we discuss other possible derivations, as well as alternate formulations that describe Brillouin phenomena. We cover the theory of Brillouin scattering in both waveguides and resonators, and present the equations for several typical settings in each case. An Appendix gives a brief introduction to linear elasticity theory for optical physicists.}

Hladky-Hennion,Journal of Sound and Vibration,194,119â€“136 (1996)]. In this paper an extension of the technique to the analysis of the propagation of acoustic waves in immersed waveguides is presented. In the proposed approach, the problem is reduced to a bidimensional problem, in which only the cross-section of the guide and the surrounding fluid domain are meshed by using finite elements. Then, wedges the top angles of which vary, are studied and the finite element results of the wedge wave speed are compared with experimental results. Finally, the conclusion indicates a way to extend this approach to waveguides of any cross-section.}
