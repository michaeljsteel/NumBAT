******************************************
Properties of bulk crystal elastic modes
******************************************

In this chapter we pause to review some of the properties of bulk elastic modes in isotropic and anisotropic crystals and learn how code within |NUMBAT| can explore these properties.
While it doesn't directly involve calculation of Brillouin gains, this material  is helpful in understanding some of the later examples/tutorials.

This material is most naturally explored interactively and so examples in this chapter are written as  Jupyter notebooks stored in the ``examples/bulkprops`` directory. (See Tutorial 9 for an introduction to NumBAT in Jupyter).
