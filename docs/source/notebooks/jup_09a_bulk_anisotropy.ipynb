    "Although much of the SBS literature assumes that the elastic materials are isotropic, anisotropy of the elastic response can be an important effect. In general, anisotropy is often more significant in elastic physics than electromagnetic physics, because of the more involved tensor nature of the elastic theory. For instance, *cubic* materials such as silicon have an isotropic linear electromagnetic response but an anisotropic elastic linear response.\n",
