    "Although much of the SBS literature assumes that the elastic materials are isotropic, anisotropy of the elastic response can be an important effect. In general, anisotropy is often more significant in elastic physics than electromagnetic physics, because of the more involved tensor nature of the elastic theory. For instance, *cubic* materials such as silicon have an isotropic linear electromagnetic response but an anisotropic elastic linear response.\n",

The lines and dots also indicate the polarisation states. It is apparent that the pink coloured mode is close to longitudinal and the blue modes are close to transverse (shear). It turns out that for a given wavevector, the group velocity is *normal* to the slowness surface. Tracing around the outer curve quasi-shear mode in the first plot can help to understand the cusps in the corresponding curve of the group velocity plot.\n",
