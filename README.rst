Welcome to NumBAT!
--------------------

NumBAT, the Numerical Brillouin Analysis Tool, integrates electromagnetic and acoustic mode solvers to calculate the interactions of optical and acoustic waves in waveguides.

NumBAT was developed by Bjorn Sturmberg, Kokou Dossou, Chris Poulton and Michael Steel in a collaboration between Macquarie University and the University of Technology Sydney, as part of the Australian Research Council Discovery Project DP160101691.
