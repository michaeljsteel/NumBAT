"""
Test simulation of a simple rectangular waveguide made of silicon.
Unlike test_case_0 this simulation creates a new FEM mesh using gmsh.
In all other ways the two simulations are idential so if there are
errors or discrepancies these almost certainly stem from gmsh!
These tests were calculated using gmsh 3.0.6. Check your version.
